# Spelling Bee
In this Repo is an app and script to solve the New York Times daily game of Spelling Bee. This will output both the pangram and a list of all (most) eligible words according to the dictionary I used.

### Usage - Streamlit App
1. INSTRUCTIONS TBD


### Usage - Regular Script
1. Clone this repository (git clone https://github.com/jack-epstein/spelling_bee)
2. Once in the proper directory, run python spelling_bee.py
3. When prompted, enter the middle letter in the puzzle (lowercase, without any extra characters)
4. When prompted, enter the outside letters with spaces in between and no extra characters
5. View answers and  brag to your friends about how smart you are!!

### Source
- The list of words comes from [Gwicks](http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm). It is worth noting that this is NOT the same source of words the New York Times uses, so the lists this script may output certain words that are not accepted by the game, and could potentially miss some used by the NY Times. I am unable to find the list that they use.
- The Spelling Bee game is made by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)
