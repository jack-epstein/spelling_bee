# Spelling Bee
In this Repo is a script to solve the New York Times daily game of Spelling Bee. This will output both the pangram and a list of all eligible words according to the dictionary I used.

### Usage
1. Clone this repository (git clone https://github.com/jack-epstein/spelling_bee)
2. Once in the proper directory, run python spelling_bee.py
3. When prompted, enter the middle letter in the puzzle (lowercase, without any extra characters)
4. When prompted, enter the outside letters with spaces in between and no extra characters
5. View answers and  brag to your friends about how smart you are!!

### Source
- The list of words comes from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words, which originally comes from [InfoChimps](www.infochimps.com). It is worth noting that this is NOT the same source of words the New York Times uses, so the lists this script will output will include many words that are not accepted by the game. I am currently looking to find a word list that is closer to the one used by NYT
- The Spelling Bee game is made by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)
